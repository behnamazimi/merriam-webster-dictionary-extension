# Merriam-Webster' Dictionary Browser Extension

**[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merriam-webster-dictionar/gmhgdiamihghcepkeapfoeakphffcdkk)**

Get the Open source Merriam-Webster's dictionary extension for FREE! It lets you quickly find English-to-English definitions for any word or phrase simply and effortlessly. Use its simple search box to type and get the definition right away, without losing your focus on the content!

You have the option to open the main definition page of a word or phrase on the Merriam-Webster website either by using the in-content button or the context menu item. You can customize this feature in the options menu.

The extension keeps track of your search history, allowing you to review your previous searches by enabling review mode in options. The relevant history found on a page will be shown in the bottom corner for your convenience.

You have the option to pause any video that's playing in the content (if there is one) when you open the search box. Once you're done looking up a definition, the video will automatically resume when you close the search box. This feature can help you save time and stay focused.

This extension uses Merriam-Webster's free services. You'll need your personal API key to put it in the extension
options to be able to use it. You can [do free registration here](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index) to get your
API key. Notice that there are different types of APIs and each has its unique
key; [read more about variants of MW dictionaries](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/index). After installing the
extension, in the options, you should choose the one which you choose on registration. You will be able to read the
required instruction in the extension options. Additionally, to make it easy to get your personal API key, you may find
some manipulations on the `dictionaryapi` website, feel free to use them. :)

Keep in mind that the default API key lets you access only 20 definitions, so get your personal key soon.
