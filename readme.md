# Merriam-Webster' Dictionary Chrome Extension

This extension uses Merriam-Webster's free services. You
can [do free register here](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index)
to get your personal API key. Then you need to put it in the options of the extension to be able to use it.

Notice that there are different types of APIs and each has its unique key. In the options, you should
choose the one which you choose on registration.

### How to install on Chrome?

1. Clone the repo or download it as a zip and extract it
2. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your Chrome browser and active **Developer mode** by clicking the
   toggle on right-top corner of the page
3. At the left-top of the same page, click on **Load unpacked** button and load the folder you just cloned or the zip
   file you have downloaded.
4. Enjoy! :)
