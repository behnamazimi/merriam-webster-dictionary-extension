# Merriam-Webster' Dictionary Chrome Extension

**[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/merriam-webster-dictionar/gmhgdiamihghcepkeapfoeakphffcdkk)**

With this extension, you would be able to look up and get the English-to-English definition of any word or phrase in the
content of a website, simply and effortlessly. Or you can use its simple search box to type and get the definition right
away, without losing your focus on the content!

It is a free face for Merriam-Webster's dictionary services, like a light version of MW's original website.

It keeps track of your search history and so you can always review your previous searches. You can also open the main
definition page of a word/phrase on Merriam-Webster's website using the in-content button, this functionality is
adjustable on the options.

You can also set the option to pause the video playing in the content (if any) when the search box is opened and replay
it when the search box is closed. It might save you some time, and you would not lose the content of the video while
looking up a definition.

This extension uses Merriam-Webster's free services. You'll need your personal API key to put it in the extension
options to be able to use it. You can [do free registration here](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index) to get your
API key. Notice that there are different types of APIs and each has its unique
key; [read more about variants of MW dictionaries](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/index). In the options, you should
choose the one which you choose on registration. You will be able to read the required instruction in the extension
options. Additionally, to make it easy to get your personal API key, you may find some manipulations on
the `dictionaryapi` website, feel free to use them. :)

### For your information:

- My personal API options are set by default to make it simple for you to test the functionality of the extension. Just
  keep in mind **you can only get 20 definitions** with the default API key, so it's a good idea to get your API key
  soon ;)

- This extension is hastily developed for personal uses so don't be shy to give any constructive feedback to improve
  it. :)
