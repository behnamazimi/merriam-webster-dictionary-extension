This extension is a free face for Merriam-Webster' free dictionary services. You can consider it as a light version of
MW's original website.

This extension allows you to look up and get the English to English definition of highlighted words in the content of a
website. Also, you can use its search box to lookup up a word it MW's resources and, you can keep track of your search
history and browse through your previous searches.
