# Merriam-Webster' Dictionary Chrome Extension

This extension is a free face for Merriam-Webster' free dictionary services. You can consider it as a light version of
MW's original website.

This extension allows you to look up and get the English to English definition of highlighted words in the content of a
website. Also, you can use its search box to lookup up a word it MW's resources and, you can keep track of your search
history and browse through your previous searches.

This extension uses Merriam-Webster's free services therefore, you'll need your personal API key to put it in the
options of the extension to be able to use it. You can [do free register here](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index)

You will be able to read the required instruction in the options.
